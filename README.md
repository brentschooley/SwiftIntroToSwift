# A Swift Introduction To Swift

This Swift playground was used for an intro to Swift 3.0 at [That Conference](http://thatconference.com).

Many code blocks feature the `#if swift(>=3.0)` syntax introduced in Swift 3. This was done so that you can see Swift 2.2 and Sift 3.0 features in the same block.
